abstract: Multi-Port RAM for Instruction & Data for a Multi-Processor System on Chip. A Multi-Processor System on Chip (MPSoC) is a System on Chip (SoC) which includes multiple Processing Units (PU). As such, it is a Multi-Core System-on-Chip. All PUs are linked to each other by a Network on Chip (NoC). These technologies meet the performance needs of multimedia applications, telecommunication architectures or network security. A Random Access Memory (RAM) is a computer memory that can be read and changed in any order, typically used to store working data and machine code. A RAM device allows data items to be read or written in almost the same amount of time irrespective of the physical location of data inside the memory. RAM contains multiplexing and demultiplexing circuitry, to connect the data lines to the addressed storage for reading or writing the entry.
